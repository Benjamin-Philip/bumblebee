Bumblebee provides pre-trained Neural Network models on top of [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon). It includes integration with [ðŸ¤— Models](https://huggingface.co/models), allowing anyone to download and perform Machine Learning tasks with few lines of code.

## Getting started

The best way to get started with Bumblebee is with [Livebook](https://livebook.dev). [Our announcement video](https://news.livebook.dev/announcing-bumblebee-gpt2-stable-diffusion-and-more-in-elixir-3Op73O) shows how to use Livebook's Smart Cells to perform different Neural Network tasks with few clicks. You can then tweak the code and deploy it.

We also provide single-file examples of running Neural Networks inside your Phoenix (+ LiveView) apps inside the [examples/phoenix](examples/phoenix) folder.

You may also check [our official docs](https://hexdocs.pm/bumblebee), which includes notebooks and our API reference. The "Tasks" section in the sidebar covers high-level APIs for using Bumblebee. The remaining modules in the sidebar lists all supported architectures.

## Installation

First add Bumblebee and EXLA as dependencies in your `mix.exs`. EXLA is an optional dependency but an important one as it allows you to compile models just-in-time and run them on CPU/GPU:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bumblebee, "~> 0.4.0"},
    {:exla, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then configure `Nx` to use EXLA backend by default in your `config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
import Config

config :nx, default_backend: EXLA.Backend
```

To use GPUs, you must [set the `XLA_TARGET` environment variable accordingly](https://github.com/elixir-nx/xla#usage).

In notebooks and scripts, use the following `Mix.install/2` call to both install and configure dependencies:

```elixir
Mix.install(
  [
    {:bumblebee, "~> 0.4.0"},
    {:exla, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ],
  config: [nx: [default_backend: EXLA.Backend]]
)
```

## Usage

To get a sense of what Bumblebee does, look at this example:

```elixir
{:ok, model_info} = Bumblebee.load_model({:hf, "bert-base-uncased"})
{:ok, tokenizer} = Bumblebee.load_tokenizer({:hf, "bert-base-uncased"})

serving = Bumblebee.Text.fill_mask(model_info, tokenizer)
Nx.Serving.run(serving, "The capital of [MASK] is Paris.")
#=> %{
#=>   predictions: [
#=>     %{score: 0.9279842972755432, token: "france"},
#=>     %{score: 0.008412551134824753, token: "brittany"},
#=>     %{score: 0.007433671969920397, token: "algeria"},
#=>     %{score: 0.004957548808306456, token: "department"},
#=>     %{score: 0.004369721747934818, token: "reunion"}
#=>   ]
#=> }
```

We load the BERT model from Hugging Face Hub, then plug it into an end-to-end pipeline in the form of "serving", finally we use the serving to get our task done. For more details check out [the documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/bumblebee) and the resources below.
